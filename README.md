# COVID-19 Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive data visualization project centered around COVID-19 data, with a primary focus on India-specific data and global trends. The project leverages Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib for static visualizations and utilizes Tableau for creating interactive charts.

## Introduction

The COVID-19 Data Visualization Project aims to provide insightful and interactive visualizations using various chart types. The project demonstrates the use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for static charts and Tableau for dynamic, interactive visualizations. The visualization techniques include map charts, horizontal bar charts, vertical bar charts, packed bubbles, and tree maps.

## Dataset

The project utilizes COVID-19 datasets, focusing on both India-specific data and global statistics. The dataset is from October month 2021 .

### Data Sources

## Visualization Techniques

The project employs various visualization techniques to represent COVID-19 data effectively. These include:

1. **Map Chart:** Geographical representation of COVID-19 cases in India and globally.
2. **Horizontal Bar Charts:** Comparative analysis of different regions or countries.
3. **Vertical Bar Charts:** Time-series analysis of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
4. **Packed Bubbles:** Visualizing data distribution with proportional bubble sizes.
5. **Tree Maps:** Hierarchical representation of COVID-19 data, breaking it down into regions and sub-regions.
